# AI-TEXT-DETECTION-MODEL---NLP
### This is a project to develop a model that heips distinguish betweeen AI generated texts and Human generated texts.
### I used a TfidVectorizer to convert texts to numeric format there after split the data to testing and training.
### I imported the MultinomialNB Model from sklearn.naives_bayes, trained the same model and got an accuracy score of 98.3% which significanlty suggest that the model is good.
### The score can still improve with subjection to tuning and testing with other models.
